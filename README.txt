EzBrzy Homework Planner 
-Version 1.0-

The EzBrzy Homework Planner mobile application has been designed with the student in mind.  The goal of the application is to allow the user to quickly enter a reminder for homework through a simple user friendly interface.  The following is a step-by-step guide to using the EzBrzy Homework Planner.

Step 1:  Download the application to your mobile device.

Step 2:  Open the application and notice the three buttons at the top of the application that allow you to transition between the three main pages.  In order to quickly add homework assignments, please take a few minutes to set up your courses.  See step 3.

Step 3:  Choose the "Courses" tab (middle tab) at the top of the application.  You will notice that no courses have been entered.  Choose the button at the bottom of the page that says "Add New Course" which will take you to a new page where you can enter course information. You are prompted for the courses title and location, and more importantly can set the default date due and default time due.  Setting defaults promotes very quick entries since you won't have to set the date or time that assignments are due later when you are in a hurry. And don't worry, the default's are adjustable anytime.  

It does take some time to get your courses set up, but you only have to do it once a semester.  Now you are ready for class and ready to add a homework assignment since you know you normally get homework on the very first day!  See next step.

Step 4:  Choose the "Assignments" tab which is located on the left side of the app at the top.  If you look below the "Assignments" tab you will see a message that tells you how many assignments are being displayed.  All assignments are displayed here so that in one glance you can see your work load.  To add an assignment, choose the "Add New Assignment" link at the bottom of the page.  You will then be prompted to choose the course that the assignment has been given for, and because of the defaults already set, you can simply choose "Save" which is located at the bottom of the page.  Three taps and you're done! Now you can edit the entry later when you have more time if need be.

Step 5:  What if you need to delete a course or an assignment?  Simply choose the course or the assignment from the respective page and there is a RED "Delete" button at the top of the page on the right hand side.  After selecting delete, a pop-up dialog box will confirm your request.  

A section is provided to record other reminders and this can be easily done by choosing the rightmost tab at the top of the page labeled "Other Reminders".  

Step 1:  Choose the "Other Reminders" tab and you will be shown a list of current reminders displayed in the same manner as homework assignments.  

Step 2: To add a reminder, choose the "Add New Reminder" button at the bottom of the page.  There is a default value set for description but all other fields should be specified by the user.  

Step 3: After the reminder has been entered, choose save at the bottom of the page.  If you do not want to save the reminder after all, just choose the back button.  

We sincerely hope that you find this application easy to use and manage so that you can focus on the tasks at hand.
